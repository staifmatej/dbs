# DBS
This repository contains the semester project from the Database systems (BI-DBS) course at CTU FIT.

During my studies, I voluntarily pursued and successfully earned two foundational Oracle Academy certifications:

- **Oracle Academy Database Design**
- **Oracle Academy Database Programming with SQL**

These certifications were not a mandatory part of the university course but reflect my proactive approach to expanding my skills and knowledge beyond the required curriculum.
