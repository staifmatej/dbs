# Achievements and Semester Project

## Oracle Academy Certifications

Based on my voluntary efforts and proactive engagement, I successfully earned two foundational Oracle Academy certifications:

- **[Oracle Academy Database Design](./oracle-academy-certifications/oracleacademy-database-design.png)**
- **[Oracle Academy Database Programming with SQL](./oracle-academy-certifications/oracleacademy-database-with-SQL.png)**

These certifications were not a mandatory part of the university course but demonstrate my commitment to expanding my skills and knowledge beyond the required curriculum.
